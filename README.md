## General info
Ludo is a very popular 2-4 person board game in Western Asia. I made an online version of this game after seeing some other version of this on the app store. This is the version made in Unity so that I can make a 3d version of the game and add some more interesting features.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_. I'm currently active on this project, committing regularly until it finishes.

## Inspiration
My main motivation for making another Ludo game was to actually implement a die that didn't have rigged values. Other Ludo games would not make use of a pure random die and so would output absurb possibilities of numbers. I set out to stop that once and for all! This Unity version also has 3d graphics and some cool animations.
